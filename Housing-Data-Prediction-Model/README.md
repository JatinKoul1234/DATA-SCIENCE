## Description

This project leverages a dataset comprising various attributes of houses, such as area, number of bedrooms, prices, and other relevant features, to develop a machine learning model for predicting housing prices. The objective is to create a robust model capable of accurately estimating the market value of residential properties, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
## Features

Algorithm: Linear Regression


## Regression Algorithm

We choose the Linear Regression algorithm for our housing price prediction model because of its simplicity and effectiveness in modeling the relationship between independent variables and the target variable. Linear Regression provides a clear interpretation of coefficients, allowing us to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted housing prices accurately.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on housing data. It was obtained from [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset)].
## Results
The Linear Regression model revealed distinct patterns in the housing data:

Large Size, Moderate Price: Properties with extensive square footage and reasonable pricing, appealing to those seeking spacious living spaces without an exorbitant cost.

Desirable Location, Premium Price: Dwellings situated in sought-after neighborhoods, commanding higher prices due to the prime location and associated amenities.

Compact, Affordable Homes: Smaller-sized properties priced affordably, catering to individuals or families with budget constraints but still seeking homeownership.

Luxury Residences: High-end properties featuring premium amenities and upscale features, commanding premium prices for a luxurious living experience.

Standard Market: Properties with average square footage and pricing, representing the norm in the housing market and appealing to a broad range of potential buyers.
